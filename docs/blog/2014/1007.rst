========

It seems that I solved an old problem which 
had been made reproducible by MN::

    SignalÃ©tique / Fournisseurs 
    "Versich"
    F9
    (cursor is on the last of 4 rows which after the following would want to be the first)
    F11
    select (alle nach Match)

    --> Error in array index

    oError:args         :
              -> VALTYPE: O CLASS: TBrowse
    oError:canDefault   : N
    oError:canRetry     : N
    oError:canSubstitute: Y
    oError:cargo        : NIL

The solution is: my test to set lGoTop only "if ! ddCheckWhile() .or. ! &sxlFilter" 
seems to come from old times and to be both 
useless and disturbing in Xbase++
